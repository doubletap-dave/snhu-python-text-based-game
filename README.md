# IDS-140 Python Text Based Game

## Description
This is a game I wrote for my IDS-140 class at Southern New Hampshire University.  It is written in Python and consists
nine rooms, with seven items that serve a pseudo-powerups. They have no effect on the game, but they are fun to collect,
with the exception they must all be collected to win the game.

## Installation
To install this game, you will need to have Python 3.8 or later installed on your computer.  You can download Python
from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.  Once you have Python installed, you can download the
game from the GitHub repository at (link here).
